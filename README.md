## Raf Arasında

The Book Review System **aka Raf Arasında** is a web application project. This project implements a web-based online book review system. In this project, the team used **PHP** technology and **MYSQL database** management system. For framework the team used **CODEIGNITER**. This system provides passionate book readers to express their feelings in order to encourage new readers to read books.

The users of this website do not have to have an account in order to search books and read the comments but they are obligated to have an account to make comments on certain books. The users can rate the books that they commented on.

The website is ready for users to join our system and able to show the other book lovers’ reviews from all around the world.
